                    <p>I originally studied foreign languages in college as a means to expand culturally and travel the world. This led me to work as an ESL teacher in Spain and India. Upon returning I freelanced in the film industry, eventually writing for DocEd shows like you'd see on NatGeo & Discovery Science. That's where I fell in love with programming...</p>

                    <p>Now I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a bias towards Front End. I am creative driven, looking for projects that abide by my mantra of "Science, Expression, & the Pursuit of Understanding." I believe in a strong merger of science and the arts, the spark in the powder keg of innovation.</p>

                    <p>When not coding, I enjoy going to comedy shows and performing sketches.</p>
